# Computer Vision


This repository is a structured and evolving collection of computer vision algorithms, aimed at understanding and optimizing vision-based techniques from fundamental principles to state-of-the-art methodologies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop, analyze, and optimize a wide range of computer vision techniques.
- Benchmark traditional vs deep learning-based vision models.
- Implement real-world applications such as facial recognition, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging.
- Enhance computational efficiency using parallelization, hardware acceleration (CUDA, OpenCL), and model pruning techniques.
- Maintain high-quality, modular, and well-documented code for ease of use and reproducibility.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
Ensure Python (>=3.8) is installed, then set up the environment:
<!-- ```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
``` -->
<!-- For GPU acceleration, install:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
``` -->

## 🚀 Usage Guide
- Notebooks (`.ipynb`) and scripts (`.py`) are organized per topic for easy reference.
<!-- - Use `configs/` to modify parameters dynamically for different experiments.
- Model performance is logged using TensorBoard (`tensorboard --logdir=logs`).
 -->
## 📊 Benchmarks & Performance
