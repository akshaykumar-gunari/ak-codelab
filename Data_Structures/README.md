# Data Structures


Welcome to the **Data Structures** repository! This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures, starting with **Stacks**.  

Each data structure is implemented with a focus on **clarity, efficiency, and ease of understanding**.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup (Dependencies)

To compile and run the programs, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **GCC Compiler** (Required for compiling C programs)  
   - Install on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

     sudo apt update && sudo apt install gcc
     ```
   - Install on Fedora:  
     ```sh

     ```
   - Install on macOS (Homebrew):  
     ```sh
     brew install gcc
     ```

2. **Bash Shell** (Required for running `build.sh`)  
   - Pre-installed on **Linux and macOS**
